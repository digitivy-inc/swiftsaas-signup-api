# Contributing to SwiftSaas Open Source

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CC Open Source! This document is
a set of guidelines to help you contribute to this project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of
Conduct][code_of_conduct].

## Project Documentation

The `README` in the root of the repository should contain or link to
project documentation. If you cannot find the documentation you're
looking for, please file a GitHub issue with details of what
you'd like to see documented.

## How to Contribute

Contribution process
Once you've found an issue you'd like to work on, please follow these steps to make your contribution:

Comment on it and say you're working on that issue. This is to avoid conflicts with others also working on the issue.
A project maintainer may mark the issue with an in progress label at this point, but we don't always get around to that.
Write your code and submit your pull request. Be sure to read and follow our pull request guidelines!
Wait for code review and address any issues raised as soon as you can.
A note on collaboration: We encourage people to collaborate as much as possible. We especially appreciate contributors reviewing each others pull requests, as long as you are kind and constructive when you do so.

Proposing a new issue
If you want to work on something that there is no GitHub issue for, follow these steps:

Create a a new GitHub issue associated with the relevant repository and propose your change there. Be sure to include implementation details and the rationale for the proposed change.
We are very reluctant to accept random pull requests without a related issue created first.
The issue will automatically have the not ready for work label applied. Wait for a project maintainer to evaluate your issue and decide whether it's something that we will accept a pull request for.
Once the project maintainer has approved the issue and removed the not ready for work label, you may start work on code as described in the "Contribution process" section above.
